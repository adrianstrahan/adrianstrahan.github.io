        <h2>Mobile or Web</h2>
        <p>I have worked on web-based delivery mechanisms for over 15 years and I have over 7 years experience in mobile application development. I have been able to combine both disciplines and have built a number of apps from scratch for a number of major, household names. These utilised the power of mobile devices whilst ensuring optimum performance - even with little or no connectivity.</p>
        <p>I understand the difference between a "web-app" and a "native app", and can help you identify the pros and cons of each approach for your specific circumstances. You don't always need a native app - but in a lot of situations, you also generally can't just offer your users a "mobile-friendly" web site.</p>

        <h2>Gathering User Requirements</h2>
        <p>I am able to liaise with users at all levels within an organisation and I'm able to quickly identify their needs and, just as importantly, manage their expectations. Once user "stories" have been identified, I can document them in an unambiguous manner to help your development team clearly understand the requirements.</p>

        <h2>Defining the User Journey</h2>
        <p>Most requirements for a product interrelate in lots of different ways and can have a number of consequences to other parts of the system. These consequences need to be fully understood and communicated effectively with both your users and your developers long before any code is actually written.</p>
        <p>Users tend only to be interested in the inputs and outputs, so I prefer to define requirements with "wire-frame" diagrams which show the screens and dialogs that a user will interact with. These allow me to visually show the effects of a user's interaction with the product and is an ideal way to communicate exactly what needs to be created. It also allows me to show each screen the user will see whilst interacting with the application, enabling the most effective "user journeys" to be thought through well in advance of implementation.</p>

        <h2>Scrum Master</h2>
        <p>Being a qualified Scrum Master (Scrum Alliance #424604) means that I can step directly into a scrum team to facilitate and help them to consistently achieve their agreed deliverables.</p>

        <h2>Product Owner</h2>
        <p>I am a certified Product Owner (Scrum Alliance #424604).</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have worked on many projects where different stakeholders have had conflicting requirements and priorities. I regularly liaise with each stakeholder to identify a coherent, overall, roadmap that delivers the required functionality in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
        <p>Having worked as a Product Owner, I am also able to liaise with your development teams to communicate the reasoning behind the priorities and identify the costs involved. I can then help to plan and manage the workloads for each sprint to ensure the timely delivery of these requirements.</p>

        <h2>Developer</h2>
        <p>I can do all the above <i>because</i> I've been a developer myself, and I still enjoy coding. I fully understand the development process and can liaise with your development team whilst understanding their requirements just as much as those of your users or clients.</p>
