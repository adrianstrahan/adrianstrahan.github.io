        <p>Hello. My name is Adrian Strahan and I specialise in software development. I am a <b>Product Owner</b>, <b>Project Manager</b>, <b>Team Leader</b> and <b>Developer</b>.</p>
        <p>I established UseGIS Ltd in 2004, with the aim of providing web development services for small companies who wanted more than just an off-the-shelf web site.</p>
        <p>Ever since then, I have managed the delivery of many web and mobile-based applications, mostly from the ground up.</p>
        <p>Utilising the latest tools and techniques, I am well versed in managing the whole process of developing software applications, from requirements gathering and systems definition through to delivery and ongoing support and improvement.</p>
        <p>I am a certified Agile <b>Product Owner</b> and <b>Scrum Master</b>. I am also a <b>Tech Editor</b> on <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/about#astrahan" target="_blank">RayWenderlich.com</a>, helping to write some of the best iOS tutorials available.</p>
        <p>I also write software, specialising in <b>iOS</b> apps utilising the <b>LAMP</b> back-end stack.</p>
        <p>Please have a look around and if you think I can help you, please don't hesitate to <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
