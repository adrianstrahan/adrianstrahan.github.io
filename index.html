        <p>Hello. My name is Adrian Strahan and I specialise in software development. I am a <b>Product Owner</b>, <b>Project Manager</b>, <b>Team Leader</b> and <b>Lead Developer</b>.</p>
        <p>I established UseGIS Ltd in 2004, with the aim of providing web development services for small companies who wanted more than just an off-the-shelf web site.</p>
        <p>Ever since then, I have managed the delivery of many web and mobile-based applications, mostly from the ground up while deliberately <i>not</i> using generic tools that only let you build generic applications.</p>
        <p>However, I always utilise the latest tools and techniques, and I am well versed in managing the whole process of developing software applications, from requirements gathering and systems definition through to delivery and ongoing support and improvement.</p>
        <p>I am a certified Agile <b>Product Owner</b> and <b>Scrum Master</b>, so I know how to work in an Agile environment - consistently delivering incremental improvements. I am also a <b>Final Pass Editor</b> on <a href="http://www.kodeco.com/about" target="_blank">kodeco.com</a> (formerly RayWenderlich.com), helping to write some of the best iOS tutorials available.</p>
        <p>I also write software, specialising in <b>iOS</b> mobile apps utilising the <b>Firebase</b> suite of back-end services.</p>
        <p>Please have a look around and if you think I can help you, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
