        <img src="images/RoyalAscot.png" alt="Royal Ascot app icon">
        <h3>2009/2010: Royal Ascot (iPhone)</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">This app was released in June 2010 for the 2010 meeting. It was designed and written entirely by myself; another team wrote the back-end server code.</p>
        <p>The app showed a list of all races for all race days, the runners and riders, live odds and race results - updated via Apple Push Notification System (APNS). It also included a map of the racecourse, together with selectable locations of restaurants and bars. 'Fun' features included Song sheets, 'Live reporter' (similar to a Twitter feed) and photos taken during the day of various events. A 'Hospitality' section included a list of restaurants, together with their menus, a timetable of events for each day, and a list of future events being held at Ascot. Finally, an 'Info' section showed up-to-date Travel, Weather, News and the current course going.</p>
        <p>A server managed the push notifications, together with the XML-based data feed and MSSQL database. In order to minimise the amount of data sent to the app and to enable the users to be able to use it when there was no connection, all the data was stored locally on the device. The data feed was also designed so that only updated information was sent.</p>
